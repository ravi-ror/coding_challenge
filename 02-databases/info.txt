Database types:
---------------

RDBMS / relational / SQL db: better for ACID compliance, high Consistency, less Availability, vertical scaling,
sharding, read replicas. Good for querying


No-SQL / Non-relational / Schemaless db: huge data, high Availability, eventual Consistency, horizontal scaling
(distributed db). Not all good for querying


> Key-value stores: Amazon DynamoDB, Couchbase, Memcached, Redis

> Column-oriented databases: A Columnar databases that use CQL include apache Cassandra, DataStax, Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB
and ScyllaDB

> Document databases: A document database stores data in JSON, BSON, or XML documents.  Documents in the database can be 
nested. Particular elements can be indexed for faster querying.

> Graph databases: A graph database focuses on the relationship between data elements. Each element is contained as a node.
  Ex: Neo4j, GraphQl
