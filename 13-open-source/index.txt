Use Github’s search tool to find projects by entering beginner-friendly contribution tags like good-first-issue,
good-first-bug, beginner-friendly, easy, low-hanging-fruit, first-timers-only, etc. Filter search results to return
issues in open states and in the languages you’d like to work in. There are tons of other tools, platforms, and
programs where you could find open source projects that I’ll list at the end of this article to help you with your
search.
